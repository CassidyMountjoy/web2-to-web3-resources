# WEB2 TO WEB3 RESOURCES
At [Decentology](https://www.decentology.com/) one of our goals is to make blockchain more accessible for mainstream users. As part of this, we're creating this repository to gather resources for people who are interested in learning, growing, and/or exploring the web3 space. Through these resources, we hope to reduce barriers to entry and create a space where the wider community can contribute to supporting each other.
